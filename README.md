# Pyxcel

Pyxcel is an interpreter for a custom language designed to create and manipulate tables. The project also includes web scraping functionality and server-side data management.

## Features

- **Table Manipulation**: Allows users to create and manage tables using a custom language.
- **Regular Expression Support**: Utilizes Python's `Regex` library to interpret and handle regular expression patterns in the language.
- **Web Scraping**: Implements a web scraper using `BeautifulSoup` (bs4) to extract data from a certain website, which is then organized into tables using the Pyxcel interpreter.
- **Server Communication**: Transfers the scraped data to a server using socket programming, where it is processed and managed on the server side.
